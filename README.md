## Description 
Social media has evolved itself as a significant tool used by people for information spread during emergencies like natural or man-made disasters. Real-time analysis of this huge collected data can play a vital role in crisis assessment, response and relief activities. We present a system which analyses the emergency-related tweets to classify them as need and available tweets. The system will further give a ranked list of tweets, along with a relevance score for each tweet with respect to the topic. Finally, for each need tweet identified its corresponding mapped availability tweets are reported.
